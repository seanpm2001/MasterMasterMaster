# Master

<!-- Notes to the editor
1. Keep it short and simple
2. Keep it neutral
!-->

Due to recent unrest, especially after the 2020 George Floyd murder and subsequent protests, people have been taking to terminology to fix issues. One notable one that people went after was master/slave. It really should have just been slave.

Master is still an acceptable word. It by itself has no negative meaning, unless you apply words like slave to it. Notable examples include:

- Kung fu master
- Master copy
- Master record
- Master Boot Record (MBR)
- Master system
- Master branch
- MasterSystem (SEGA console)
- Master (expert)
- Webmaster
- and more

A lot of people have been trying to get rid of any reference to the word `master` I don't believe this is the right move, I think getting rid of the slave terminology was enough. Replacing `master` with `main` doesn't work everywhere either. For the time being, I will still use `master` in my projects and documentation, just like I always have been using it. I won't go out of my way to rename all `main` branches to `master` as it would be pointless.
